abstract = {Cell cycle-dependent gene transcription is tightly controlled by the retinoblastoma (RB):E2F and DREAM complexes, which repress all cell cycle genes during quiescence. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation of RB and DREAM allows for the expression of two gene sets. The first set of genes, with peak expression in G1/S, is activated by E2F transcription factors (TFs) and is required for DNA synthesis. The second set, with maximum expression during G2/M, is required for mitosis and is coordinated by the MuvB complex, together with B-MYB and Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1). In this review, we summarize the key findings that established the distinct control mechanisms regulating G1/S and G2/M gene expression in mammals and discuss recent advances in the understanding of the temporal control of these genes.}
