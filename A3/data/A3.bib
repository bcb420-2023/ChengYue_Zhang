abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.}}

abstract = {Cell cycle-dependent gene transcription is tightly controlled by the retinoblastoma (RB):E2F and DREAM complexes, which repress all cell cycle genes during quiescence. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation of RB and DREAM allows for the expression of two gene sets. The first set of genes, with peak expression in G1/S, is activated by E2F transcription factors (TFs) and is required for DNA synthesis. The second set, with maximum expression during G2/M, is required for mitosis and is coordinated by the MuvB complex, together with B-MYB and Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1). In this review, we summarize the key findings that established the distinct control mechanisms regulating G1/S and G2/M gene expression in mammals and discuss recent advances in the understanding of the temporal control of these genes.}
